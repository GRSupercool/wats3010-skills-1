            <h4>Thoreau Uses Imagery</h4>

            <article>
                <p>Let us consider for a moment what most of the trouble and anxiety which I have referred to is about,
                    and how much it is necessary that we be troubled, or, at least, careful. It would be some advantage
                    to live a primitive and frontier life, though in the midst of an outward civilization, if only to
                    learn what are the gross necessaries of life and what methods have been taken to obtain them; or
                    even to look over the old day-books of the merchants, to see what it was that men most commonly
                    bought at the stores, what they stored, that is, what are the grossest groceries. For the
                    improvements of ages have had but little influence on the essential laws of manâ€™s existence; as our
                    skeletons, probably, are not to be distinguished from those of our ancestors

            <article>
                <p>I cannot believe that our factory system is the best mode by which men may get clothing. The
                    condition of the operatives is becoming every day more like that of the English; and it cannot be
                    wondered at, since, as far as I have heard or observed, the principal object is, not that mankind
                    may be well and honestly clad, but, unquestionably, that corporations may be enriched. In the long
                    run men hit only what they aim at. Therefore, though they should fail immediately, they had better
                    aim at something high.</p>

            <h3>Self Reliance </h3>
            <h4>Emerson Uses Abstraction</h4>
            <article>
                <p>Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string. Accept the place the divine providence has
                    found for you, the society of your contemporaries, the connection of events. Great men have always
                    done so, and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age, betraying their perception
                    that the absolutely trustworthy was seated at their heart, working through their hands,
                    predominating in all their being. And we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind the same
                    transcendent destiny; and not minors and invalids in a protected corner, not cowards fleeing before
                    a revolution, but guides, redeemers, and benefactors, obeying the Almighty effort, and advancing on
                    Chaos and the Dark.</p>
